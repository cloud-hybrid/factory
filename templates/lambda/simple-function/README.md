With special considerations made to the following teams:

- Quality Assurance (Testing)
- Development (Local Usability, Invocation)
- Security (Secrets)
- System Administration (Logging & Monitoring)
- DevOps (Deployments)

`lambda-template` provides developers an opinionated framework for creative design and freedom(s),
as well as configuration options and packaging strategies to facilitate cross-team requirements.

The following template serves as a wrapper for Lambda Functions, and makes best efforts towards 
security, configuration, deployments, and unit-testing without incurring overhead for development
teams.
