  - [ ] `chalk` is deprecating `underline`
    - [ ] Ensure to discuss how the use of `ANSI("[Color]", "[Content]")` doesn't break, massively accross

  - [ ] Current color packages seem rather convuluded or difficult to maintain
  - [ ] Type-Hinting
    - [ ] Include IDE examples (images)
    - [ ] Provide example of a TypeScript Yargs CLI package
      - [ ] Create
    - [ ] Provide example of a TypeScript Commander CLI package
