# `cloud-factory` - Construct Utilities #

**A CLI Utility to Manage Software-Defined State**

`cloud-factory` is a commandline application that provides ci-cd capabilities,
code extensions, and overall utilities for cloud-related management and
development.

In order to begin, open a `node.js` capable console and then run the following command:
   - `npx --yes cloud-factory@latest --help`

## Task Board ##

- [ ] **Integrate Remote State**
    - Example:
     ```javascript
     // S3 Backend - https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html
     new S3Backend(this, {
        bucket: "mybucket",
        key: "path/to/my/key",
        region: "us-east-1",
     });
   
     // S3 Remote State
     const otherState = new DataTerraformRemoteStateS3(this, "other", {
        bucket: "myotherbucket",
        key: "path/to/my/key",
     });
   
     // Reference Remote State
     new s3.DataAwsS3BucketObject(this, "object", {
        bucket: "objectbucket",
        key: otherState.get("bucket_key"),
     });
     ```

## Usage ##

There exists a few different ways to run `cloud-factory`, depending on the context.

- [**Development Usage**](#development-usage)
- [**NPX Global Usage**](#npx-global-usage)
- [**NPM System Usage**](#npm-system-usage)

#### Development Usage ####

While locally developing, the application can be started via the `start` command located in `package.json`:

```bash
# Start
npm run start

# Help
npm run start -- --help

# Environment Sub-Command Example
npm run start -- environment
```

**Note**: a `--` is required between the `run-script` command, and CLI input. This is due to limitations around
`npm`, and parsing input.

### NPX Global Usage ###

Running via `npx` is the preferred method, and runs against the most recently-published `NPM` package.

```bash
# Start
npx --yes cloud-factory@latest

# Help
npx --yes cloud-factory@latest --help

# Environment Sub-Command Example
npx --yes cloud-factory@latest environment
```

**Note**: the `--yes` flag is only required to bypass the `install` prompt. Once installed, 
the `--yes` flag can be optionally included without prompt.

### NPM System Usage ###

`cloud-factory` can optionally be installed globally to any `npm`-capable system.

First, run `npm install --global cloud-factory`. Then, `cloud-factory` can be used
similar to any other installed executable:

```bash
# Installation
npm install --global cloud-factory@latest
```

```bash
# Start
cloud-factory

# Help
cloud-factory --help

# Environment Sub-Command Example
cloud-factory environment
```

## Example(s) - A Lambda Deployment ##

*The following example deploys a __single__ Lambda function*, but includes, implicitly, the following
resources:

- Lambda Function
- A Lambda Layer
- API Gateway
- X-Ray Enablement
- Log-Groups
- SSM Parameter(s)

**Note**, the only requirement would be a Lambda Function, but for the sake of demonstration, the example
includes a Lambda **Layer**, too.

***All other resources are defined dynamically by `cloud-factory`.***

1. Define and create a new directory
    - `mkdir -p example`
    - `cd example`
2. Clone source(s)
   1. **Lambda Function**
      - `git clone https://github.com/cloud-hybrid/lambda-function-concept.git ./test-function`
   2. **Lambda Layer**
      - `git clone https://github.com/cloud-hybrid/lambda-layer-concept.git ./library/test-layer`
3. *Define a `factory.json` file*:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Concept",
        "organization": "Cloud-Vault",
        "environment": "Development"
    }
    ```
    - i.e. 
    ```bash
    cat << "EOF" > factory.json
    {
        "name": "Concept",
        "organization": "Cloud-Vault",
        "environment": "Development"
    }
    EOF
    ```
4. Ensure the current directory takes the following shape:
   ```
   example
     ├── factory.json
     ├── test-function
     └── library
         └── test-layer
   ```
5. With the current-working-directory set to `example`, run:
   ```bash
   npx --yes cloud-factory@latest ci-cd initialize --debug
   ```
   - Feel free to omit the `--debug` flag. It's only included for verbosity and
   understanding
6. Verify that a `distribution` folder was created.
7. Deploy the lambda function + layer: 
    ```
    npx --yes cloud-factory@latest ci-cd deploy --debug
    ```
8. Type `"y"` (without quotes) when prompted to confirm the deployment
9. A hyperlink will be provided upon successful completion. With reference to the example,
navigating to `https://v41dkt0ik0.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/development/test-function` will
then provide a JSON response body containing information about the package, and the lambda function's
layer

**Synopsis**
```bash
mkdir -p example && cd example

git clone https://github.com/cloud-hybrid/lambda-function-concept.git ./test-function

git clone https://github.com/cloud-hybrid/lambda-layer-concept.git ./library/test-layer

cat << "EOF" > factory.json
 {
     "name": "Concept",
     "organization": "Cloud-Vault",
     "environment": "Development"
 }
 EOF

npx --yes cloud-factory@latest ci-cd initialize --debug
npx --yes cloud-factory@latest ci-cd deploy --debug
```

### Overwrites ###

***Note - The following section is under heavy, active development.*** Please refer to the example for 
usage expectations until otherwise updated.

There exist a few places to define overwrites for certain resource-related attributes ...

#### `package.json` ####

Individual repository's `package.json` can define a root-level key "`factory`", assigning an object
as its value:

```json
{
   "name": "cloud-technology-http-api-get-users",
   "...": "...",
   "factory": {
      "name": "get-users",
      "branch": "feature/get-user-configuration",
      "environment": "QA"
   }
}
```

For example, let the aforementioned JSON snippet represent a lambda function; `cloud-factory` will 
instead use `*/*/get-users` as the API-Gateway-V2 integration endpoint instead of the much longer,
undesired `cloud-technology-http-api-get-users` value.

#### `factory.json` (Repository Specific) ####

...

#### `factory.overwrites.json` ####

...

## Design Philosophy ##

> *Constructs are classes which define a “piece of system state”. Constructs can be composed 
> together to form higher-level building blocks which represent more complex state. Constructs 
> are often used to represent the desired state of cloud applications. For example, in the AWS 
> CDK, which is used to define the desired state for AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation, 
> the lowest-level construct represents a resource definition in a CloudFormation template. 
> These resources are composed to represent higher-level logical units of a cloud application, 
> etc.*

The design philosophies and motivations behind `cloud-factory` are simple:

- Eliminate drift between deployable(s) across environments
- Create an agnostic interface to generate and deploy distribution(s)
- Configure opinionated defaults with zero impact on development teams

### Overview ###

At a high level, `cloud-factory` receives a set of repositories as **input**, executes **directory translations** and potentially compile(s) code,
and **outputs** a *distribution*. The distribution is composed of an opinionated structure that later fulfills deployment requirements. Through analysis of
repository layout(s) & dependencies, a series of constructs, or cloud resources, are dynamically composed into a
singular stack -- the stack becomes the deployable.

When lower level constructs -- **repositories** -- become capable of implicitly defining
infrastructure-related requirements, a large portion of development overhead and maintenance can be eliminated.

### Opinionated Defaults ###

An ***opinionated default*** can be any additional or non-default attribute that assists defining a cloud resource. For
example, in Azure, GCP, and AWS, resources can have *Tags*. Through key-value assignment, a subset of resources can all
be attributed an **Environment** *key* with a `Development`
value.

While seemingly of little value, parsers or API scrappers can use these tags to filter through applicable resources.
Billing, security auditing, and patch-groups are all but some benefits administrators can gain from assigning
tag-related opinionated defaults.

### Packaging Structure ###

With the following example structure:

```
.
├── factory.json
│
├── library
│    └── shared-resource-1
│        ├── LICENSE
│        ├── README.md
│        ├── package.json
│        └── src
│            └── index.js
│
├── cloud-resource-1
│    ├── LICENSE
│    ├── README.md
│    ├── package.json
│    └── src
│        └── index.js
│
└── cloud-resource-2
     ├── LICENSE
     ├── README.md
     ├── package.json
     └── src
          └── index.js
```

`cloud-factory` takes note of the following directories:

```
.
├── factory.json
├── library
│    └── shared-resource-1
├── cloud-resource-1
└── cloud-resource-2
```

However, also take note that the following example's `cloud-resource-2` is *no different* compared to the first example:

```
.
├── ...
├── arbitrary-folder-name
│    └──cloud-resource-2
│        ├── LICENSE
│        ├── README.md
│        ├── package.json
│        └── src
│            └── index.js
```

`cloud-factory` will transform the `cloud-resource-2` directory using the same translations in both examples
when the distribution gets compiled:

```
.
├── cloud-resource-1
│    ├── LICENSE
│    ├── README.md
│    ├── package.json
│    └── src
│         └── index.js
│
├── arbitrary-folder-name
│    └── cloud-resource-2
│         ├── LICENSE
│         ├── README.md
│         ├── package.json
│         └── src
│              └── index.js
│
└── distribution
     ├── cloud-resource-1
     │    └── ...
     └── cloud-resource-2
          └── ...
```

The freedom of repository-based folder structuring is just one of the
abstractions `cloud-factory` will perform -- therefore limiting deployment and vcs requirements, or otherwise
development-related overhead.

Regardless of any automated or otherwise pipeline'd implementation (deployments can also be performed locally), the design pattern is always the same:
   - *Clone in a remote repository to an arbitrary ci environment*

Programmatic logic can then be easily abstracted according to repository-to-directory mapping(s).
